- Variables and naming conventions  
- Changing data types  
- Flowcharts  
- Boolean values and comparison operators  
- Flow control statements  
- Loops (`for`, `while`) and `range()`  
- Importing modules  
- Functions, return values, and `None`  
- Local and global scope  
- Exception handling

#### **Challenges & Notes:**  

1. **Remembering Operators**  
   - It's tough to keep track of all operators right now. (Iâ€™ll practice more to make them stick!)  

2. **Converting Data Types**  
   - Switching between strings and integers feels tricky, but Iâ€™ll get better with time.  

3. **Boolean and Comparison Operators**  
   - Sometimes itâ€™s confusing when they mix together. I know itâ€™s simple, but it feels like magic when it works, and I canâ€™t explain why. ðŸ˜…  

4. **Loops Need Planning**  
   - Without a clear goal for loops, itâ€™s easy to lose track. Iâ€™ll experiment more to get the hang of it.  

5. **Understanding `None`**  
   - Why does `None` exist in the first place? Right now, itâ€™s confusing, but I hope one day itâ€™ll make perfect sense.  

6. **Global vs. Local Variables**  
   - Hereâ€™s how I think of them:  
     - **Global Variables**: Like friends you meet frequently while workingâ€”always around.  
     - **Local Variables**: Like strangers you meet once on a trip and may never see again.  

7. **Collatz Sequence Challenge**  
   - I got stuck trying to figure out how to call the function recursively until it reached `1`.  
   - The biggest issue was forgetting to update the `num` variable after each loop iteration.

#### **Plan for Improvement:**  

- Practice operators with small coding exercises daily.  
- Work on type conversion exercises (e.g., reverse a string and convert it to an integer, and vice versa).  
- Experiment with combining boolean and comparison operators in simple scenarios to understand their behavior.  
- Plan the logic for loops before coding to avoid confusion.  
- Read more about the purpose of `None` and why itâ€™s important in Python.  
- Try the Collatz Sequence AGAIN, focusing on updating variables properly.
