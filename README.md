# Python Practice 🐍

This repository contains my Python learning journey. Each week, I document what I’ve learned and include exercises or projects I’ve worked on.

## Structure
- More weeks will be added as I progress.

## Why This Repo?
I created this repository to track my progress in Python, improve my programming skills, and showcase my learning journey.
